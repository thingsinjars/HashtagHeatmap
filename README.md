Hashtag Heatmap
===============

or

#tweatmap
--------

This uses the Nokia Maps API and the Twitter Search API to search for, geocode and display tweets containing any hashtag. The heatmap-style display means that areas with more tweets are more intensely coloured than those fewer.

Sample heatmap for the hashtag #dinosaur*

The Code
========
The majority of the code is designed to create the search, process each tweet and geocode. The actual display of tweets as a heatmap is pretty much directly taken from the [Nokia Maps API Playground](http://api.maps.nokia.com/2.1.0/playground/index.html?example=densityheatmap).

The code is thoroughly documented so it should be easy to follow. If you have a questions, just [ask on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@thingsinjars%20Yo,)
